This package contains Go implementations of the WGSL shaders. They serve as a
debug aid, not a viable CPU fallback. Currently all shaders with the exception
of the fine rasterization have been implemented.

This package is a manual rewrite of the Rust implementation of the CPU shaders
in Vello, which can be found at [1].
