    Encode valid empty paths for empty clips (#651)
    
    There was logic to encode a valid empty path when the clip path was
    empty, but this logic was ineffective because of empty line segment
    culling. This patch directly encodes an empty path (single zero-length
    line).
    
    Also includes a doc improvement for `push_layer`.
    
    Fixes #644
